## HAWP installation

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cherubicXN/hawp.git ./third-party/hawp
python -m pip install -e ./third-party/hawp
```

Since HAWP (original link: [https://github.com/cherubicXN/hawp](https://github.com/cherubicXN/hawp)) is still under active development and we do not want to block the user from using the newest version, it is now listed as a separate dependency.
